# BILIG LMS — landing page

Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS port of the BILIG LMS
marketing landing page (dark/light themed, Mongolian copy).

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — brand tokens as CSS variables, bridged into Tailwind
  utilities via `@theme inline` in `app/globals.css`
- **next/font** — Unbounded / Onest / JetBrains Mono, self-hosted with the
  Cyrillic subset for the Mongolian copy

## Getting started

                         # (Tailwind needs literal class strings, not
                         # `text-${color}` interpolation)
  emphasis.tsx           # Renders "*emphasised*" substrings from content.ts
                         # as brand-colored <em>
  money.tsx              # Works around the ₮ (Tugrik) glyph missing from
                         # the display typeface
```

## Theming

Dark is the default and primary theme. `data-theme="dark" | "light"` on
`<html>` switches the whole palette — every brand/surface/text color is a CSS
variable in `app/globals.css`, redefined under `[data-theme="light"]`. The
initial value is stamped before hydration by an inline script in
`app/layout.tsx` (no flash of the wrong theme); `ThemeToggle` flips the
attribute and persists the choice to `localStorage`.

Tailwind utilities like `bg-blue`, `text-txt-2`, `border-line` resolve to
these variables via `@theme inline`, so they react to the theme switch
automatically. Bespoke, brand-specific chrome that doesn't fit Tailwind's
utility model (decorative arcs, the gradient promo band, the schedule grid,
staggered cards, the FAQ accordion marker, scroll-reveal) lives in
`app/globals.css` under `@layer components` as `.c-*` classes.

## Deployment

Live at **https://bilig.systems** and **https://www.bilig.systems** — both
names serve this site directly; neither redirects to the other.

Push to `main` is the whole deploy story. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

1. **verify** — `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`.
2. **build** — builds `Dockerfile` and pushes
   `ghcr.io/erdene-vvl/bilig-landing:<commit-sha>` (plus `:latest`) to GHCR.
   The droplet has 2 vCPU and never builds the image itself.
3. **deploy** — SSHes to the droplet as `deploy` and runs
   `/opt/bilig/deploy.sh landing <image>`, which pins the tag in
   `/opt/bilig/app/.env`, pulls, restarts the container, waits for its
   healthcheck, and **rolls back to the previous image** if it never turns
   healthy. A smoke test then checks both public URLs.

Because the tag is the commit SHA, a rollback is just re-running an older
deploy, and a reboot brings back exactly the image CI last verified.

### Server layout

The site runs as the `landing` service of the shared `bilig` compose project
at `/opt/bilig/app/docker-compose.prod.yml`, listening on `127.0.0.1:3103`
alongside `student` (3100), `tenant` (3101) and `admin` (3102). nginx
(`/etc/nginx/sites-available/bilig.systems.conf`) terminates TLS for both
hostnames with a Let's Encrypt certificate (`bilig-landing`) and proxies to
3103; plain HTTP 301s to HTTPS.

The image needs no configuration — the site is entirely static content
compiled into the bundle, with no backend calls and no secrets.

Repo secret: `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`, the private half of a deploy-only SSH key
authorized for the `deploy` user on the droplet.
